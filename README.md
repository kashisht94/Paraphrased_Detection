# Paraphrased_Detection
Quora is a popular question answer platform to share knowledge and enagaging in discussions about varying topics. Enormous numbers of users makes it unavoidable to have multiple questions fro different users with same intent. The major aim of the project is to effectively identify duplicate questions, which makes it easier to find high quality answers, and in turn would result in an improved user experience for readers and writers on the platform.

Utilized Deep learning algorithms to perform paraphrase prediction using Quora Dataset. The project uses Siamese Architecture with two different variants:
- Siamese Architecture with LSTM model
- Siamese Architecture with GRU model
